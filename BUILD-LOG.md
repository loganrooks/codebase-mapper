# BUILD LOG

## 2026-05-01 — Phase A implementation slice

- Decision: Treat the active `VISION.md` goal as the repo-defined instruction to build CBM from the seed kit, starting with `docs/roadmap.md` Phase A.
- Scope: Add a conservative Python CLI foundation for `cbm-init`, `cbm-map`, `cbm-validate`, `cbm-verify-citations`, and `cbm-handoff`, plus tests. This slice does not implement runtime subagent orchestration or qualitative Surface Mapper/Skeptic behavior.
- Rationale: The roadmap's first acceptance gate depends on deterministic schema validation and citation resolution. Those mechanical gates can be implemented without changing the kit's contracts.
- Alternative considered: Start by rewriting schemas or narrowing v1.2 docs back to the MVP's six-schema wording. Rejected because schema changes are contract-bearing and the current v1.2 kit already defines the authoritative artifact surface.
- Reversibility: Additive implementation files under `cbm/`, `tests/`, and packaging metadata. Existing kit documents remain unchanged in this slice.
- Verification plan: Run unit tests against a temporary git fixture; validate the shipped example frontmatter; run the CLI through init/map/handoff on the fixture and verify citations resolve.

## 2026-05-01 — Phase A smoke verification

- Implemented: Python package `cbm` with commands `cbm init`, `cbm map`, `cbm validate`, `cbm verify-citations`, and `cbm handoff`; console-script aliases are declared for the contract command names in `pyproject.toml`.
- Implemented: `cbm-init` writes `intake.json`, `state.json`, `extractor-registry.json`, `evidence-ledger.jsonl`, and `uncertainty-register.jsonl` under `.research/<run_id>/`.
- Implemented: `cbm-map` emits a schema-validated deterministic `codebase-map.json` with file inventory, language counts, build/test/CI/config candidates, coverage, and staleness metadata.
- Implemented: `cbm-handoff` emits a draft findings card and handoff from deterministic evidence, writes ledger and uncertainty entries, and reports the missing qualitative Skeptic review honestly.
- Verification run:
  - `pytest -q` passed: 2 tests.
  - `python3 -m cbm validate examples/intervention-card-example.md --repo .` passed.
  - Smoke run `run-phase-a-smoke-2`: `init`, `map`, and `handoff` completed.
  - `python3 -m cbm validate .research/run-phase-a-smoke-2/codebase-map.json --repo .` passed.
  - `python3 -m cbm validate .research/run-phase-a-smoke-2/findings/int-0001.md --repo .` passed.
  - `python3 -m cbm verify-citations .research/run-phase-a-smoke-2/findings/int-0001.md --repo .` resolved `AGENTS.md:1@59cecd752ff2`.
  - `python3 -m cbm validate .research/run-phase-a-smoke-2/handoff.md --repo .` passed.
- Self-critique:
  - Drift check: This slice stays inside the deterministic kernel and does not make CBM a code generator or chat surface.
  - Contract check: Generated codebase map, findings card, and handoff validate against current schemas; citation resolution works on the generated card.
  - Reviewer-eye check: The generated findings card is intentionally low-confidence and structural. It is not a substitute for Surface Mapper/Skeptic output; the handoff caveat names this boundary.
- Remaining Phase A gaps: runtime Surface Mapper production of `surface-map.json`; Skeptic weak-claim review; orchestrator flow that produces an actually goal-specific actionable card rather than the current structural proof card.
